I am an assistant professor in the Gildart Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering at Fairleigh Dickinson University and lead the Computer Systems Laboratory at FDU-Vancouver. My research group largely works in workload characterization, computer architecture and operating systems. Specifically, my work improves memory systems in the computer system's domain by analyzing workloads.

Prior to joining FDU, I was a faculty member in the School of Computing and Academic Studies at British Columbia Institute of Technology. I was a software engineer at Oracle(2017) and ARM(2018) in San Francisco Bay Area. I received my Ph.D.(2017) and M.S.(2014) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. I recieved a B.S.(2011) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.

I am looking for motivated students and I want to be a great adviser. I believe that this can happen if and only if we share the passion in the research area. You can take a look at research interests and publications. I believe that the best way to get to know me is to take one of my classes or work with me on a project. If you think that we can maintain in such relationship, please send me an email on your interests in one of the topics that I work on.
