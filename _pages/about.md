I am an assistant professor in the Gildart Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering at Fairleigh Dickinson University and lead the Computer Systems Laboratory at FDU-Vancouver. My research group largely works in workload characterization, computer architecture and operating systems. Specifically, my work imrpoves memory systems in the computer system's domain by analyzing workloads.

Prior to joining FDU, I was a faculty member in the School of Computing and Academic Studies at Bristish Columbia Institute of Technology. I was a software engineer at Oracle(2017) and ARM(2018) in San Francisco Bay Area. I received my Ph.D.(2017) and M.S.(2014) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. I recived an B.S.(2011) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.

I am looking for motivated students and I want to be a great adviser. I believe that this can happen if and only if we share the passion in the research area. You can tak ea look at my research page. Furthermore, the fruitful outcome comes when we are able to communicate each other well. I believe that the best way to do this is to take one of my classes or work with me on a project. If you think that we can maintain in such relationship, please send me an email on your interests in one of the topics that I work on.
